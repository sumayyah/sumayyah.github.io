I'm currently a Senior Android Developer at Square, and this is my tenth (!) year of Android development. In that time, I've worked at early-stage startups, large corporations, and freelanced. It's been a long and fun journey, and to this day I enjoy making robust, performant, delightful apps. 

I'm also a frequent conference speaker on Android and career topics, so check out my Speaking page to see my talks.
